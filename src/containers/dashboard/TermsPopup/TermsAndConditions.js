    <strong>Last Updated 21 March 2018</strong>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      1.1 Starflow AB is developing the Platform, which is intended to serve
      four constituencies: “<strong>creators</strong>” (artists, athletes,
      celebrities and others who create content and who have influence with fans
      on social media), “<strong>consumers</strong>” (fans of the creators who
      consume their content on social media), “<strong>brands</strong>”
      (companies that wish to engage and collaborate with the creators to market
      to the consumers) and “<strong>value providers</strong>” (persons who
      engage and support creators to maximise the quality, value and reach of
      content). The Platform is being designed to enhance the efficiency of the
      ‘influencer economy’ by enabling consumers to connect directly to
      creators; creators to control and directly monetise the content made
      available to consumers; and brands to engage creators (directly and
      through value providers) and measure the effectiveness of consumer
      marketing campaigns directly and transparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.2 A central feature of the Platform will be the use of Tokens that will
      serve as (a) the exclusive means for brands to pay creators, whether
      directly or through value providers, for their services in connection with
      marketing campaigns to be conducted on the Platform and (b) the only
      accepted means of acquiring and redeeming a second type of token (“<strong
      >
        ProtoStar
      </strong>”) that is internal to the Platform (collectively, the “<strong>
        Intended Purposes
      </strong>”). Tokens will be available for use as a means for payment
      immediately after they are distributed and unlocked for trading, but they
      will only be capable of use with the Platform when the Platform is
      deployed for commercial use (“<strong>Launch</strong>”). A version of the
      Platform that does not contain any Token-enabled features is presently
      available as an app for iOS devices. For the avoidance of doubt, in these
      Terms the word ‘Platform’ refers only to future versions of the Platform
      that will have Token-enabled features.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3 The Platform will be designed to interoperate with, and the Tokens
      will be created and transacted on, the Ethereum blockchain platform (“<strong
      >
        Ethereum
      </strong>”). The Tokens will be designed to comply with the Ethereum
      ERC-20 Token Standard and will be freely transferable among Ethereum
      account holders. The Tokens will be created and distributed by an ERC-20
      smart contract (the “<strong>TS Contract</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      1.4 ProtoStars will be the only accepted means to pay the fees to access
      premium content, merchandise, contests, fan club memberships and similar
      items on the Platform. ProtoStars can be acquired with, and redeemed for,
      Tokens at the rate of 1,000 ProtoStars per Token. ProtoStars can also be
      acquired with fiat currency through the Platform’s internal virtual
      currency exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.5 Starflow is conducting the Token Sale before Launch to broaden support
      of the Platform and to accelerate adoption of the Platform at Launch.
      During the Token Sale, eligible purchasers (see clause 2.2 below) may use
      a designated virtual currency to buy Tokens (see paragraph 2 of Schedule
      2). Starflow intends to use the proceeds of the Token Sale for the
      purposes described in paragraph 10 of Schedule 2; however, Starflow
      reserves the right to use the proceeds of the Token Sale for any purposes
      Starflow may determine in its discretion. Starflow makes no undertaking,
      representation or warranty in respect of its use of those proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.6 The expected utility and value of the Platform and the Tokens are
      important considerations for prospective purchasers of Tokens. However,
      due to the risks described in Schedule 3 and other risks that may not be
      anticipated, Starflow does not guarantee that the Platform or the Tokens
      will have a specific, or any, utility or value. Your payment to Starflow
      is not refundable even if the Platform and/or the Tokens have no utility
      or value. You acknowledge that the failure of the Tokens, if delivered to
      you, to have any monetary, utilitarian or other value will not be a
      failure of the essential purpose of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.7 Descriptions of the Platform and the Tokens and other information
      about the Starflow Group, the Token Sale and the Starflow Group’s overall
      project related to the Platform are available on Starflow’s website at
      https://www.starflow.com (the “<strong>Website</strong>”), including
      Starflow’s Whitepaper version 1.11 (dated 6 March 2018) (collectively, the
      “<strong>Project Documentation</strong>”). The Project Documentation
      states Starflow’s current views of the subjects it covers. Starflow may
      from time to time revise the Project Documentation in any respect and
      without notice to or approval from you. The information presented in the
      Project Documentation is indicative only; the Project Documentation does
      not form part of these Terms or represent a commitment by Starflow.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2. Contracting Party and Eligibility to Participate in the Token Sale
    </h2>

    <p>
      2.1 The party that is legally bound by these Terms (and that is identified
      in these Terms as ‘you’) is either:
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) the individual who accepted these Terms when submitting your Order
      (the “<strong>Signatory</strong>”); or
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) the individual or entity, if any, that legally authorised the
      Signatory to accept these Terms on its behalf (the “<strong>
        Principal
      </strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Signatory asserts that there is a Principal but the individual or
      entity identified as the Principal (i) does not fully satisfy the
      Eligibility Conditions under clause 2.2 below or (ii) is for any reason
      not legally bound by these Terms, then the Signatory will be bound by
      these Terms in his or her personal capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.2 To be eligible to participate in the Token Sale, you must satisfy each
      of the following conditions (collectively, the “<strong>
        Eligibility Conditions
      </strong>”):
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you are an individual:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        you are above the minimum age in your jurisdiction to have the legal
        capacity to enter into contracts and to use, hold, trade, buy, sell or
        transfer Tokens;
      </li>
      <li>
        you have accepted these Terms yourself and not through another person;
        and
      </li>
      <li>you are not an Excluded Person (as defined in Schedule 1).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em>OR</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you are an entity:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        you are duly organised and validly existing under the applicable laws of
        the jurisdiction of your organisation;
      </li>
      <li>
        you have authorised the person who accepted these Terms on your behalf
        to do so; and
      </li>
      <li>
        neither you nor any of your beneficial owners are an Excluded Person.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your participation in the Token Sale and your using, holding, trading,
      buying, selling or transferring (collectively, “<strong>
        dealing in
      </strong>”) Tokens is not prohibited, restricted or regulated by any law
      or regulation applicable to you. You are solely responsible (i) to
      determine if there are any such laws or regulations (including foreign
      exchange restrictions or restrictions under securities laws) applicable to
      you and to comply with them and (ii) to determine if there are any
      governmental or other consents or approvals which you need to obtain, and
      to obtain and maintain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are purchasing the Tokens as principal and for your own account, and
      not as nominee or agent for, or for the account of, any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are a sophisticated purchaser who understands the technology and risks
      of cryptographic tokens, particularly the risks associated with your
      private keys being lost, stolen or compromised. You understand how
      cryptocurrency wallets and other token storage mechanisms work, the risks
      of using them, and the risks of using them incorrectly. You understand
      smart contract technology and blockchain technology and the limitations
      and risks of systems built using those technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.3 If you do not fully satisfy each of the Eligibility Conditions at all
      times from the time that you accept these Terms, then you may not, and you
      agree not to, participate in the Token Sale or purchase Tokens. If you
      participate in the Token Sale or purchase Tokens notwithstanding that you
      do not meet each of the Eligibility Conditions, you acknowledge that (a)
      your participation in the Token Sale or purchase of Tokens is a breach of
      these Terms (including clause 7 (Your Representations and Warranties)),
      (b) your purchase of Tokens under your Order is at your own risk and (c)
      Starflow may reject or cancel your Order at any time without notice to
      you. Without prejudice to clauses 10.1 and 11.1 below, you acknowledge and
      agree that Starflow will not be liable to you or any other party arising
      from or in connection with your participation in the Token Sale if you do
      not meet each of the Eligibility Conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>3. The Token Sale Smart Contract</h2>

    <p>
      3.1 Key elements of the Token Sale are implemented in the TS Contract. The
      TS Contract is open source and available for inspection at{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/starflowapp/" target="_blank">
        https://github.com/starflowapp/
      </a>. The executable code of the TS Contract is incorporated into these
      Terms by this reference. For the avoidance of doubt, the comments and
      other non-executable code in the source code of the TS Contract are for
      convenience only and are not incorporated into these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2 You understand the nature of smart contracts and that, once deployed,
      their functionality cannot be overridden or bypassed. Accordingly, to the
      extent the execution of the TS Contract produces results that conflict
      with any term or statement of these Terms, your Order, the Project
      Documentation or any other document provided by or on behalf of Starflow
      (all, collectively, the “<strong>Off-Chain Documents</strong>”), or to the
      extent the Off-Chain Documents contain a term or statement that could have
      been implemented in the TS Contract but was not, the TS Contract will
      prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3 A technical expert engaged by Starflow (the “<strong>
        Code Auditor
      </strong>”) has audited the TS Contract. The report of the Code Auditor
      will be available at{' '}
      <a href="https://starflow.com/ico" target="_blank">
        https://starflow.com/ico
      </a>. However, the audit is intended only to enhance the performance and
      security of the TS Contract. Neither Starflow nor the Code Auditor
      warrants or guarantees the operation of the TS Contract. The results of
      the audit do not form part of these Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Tokens</h2>
    <p>
      4.1 The attributes of Tokens and their role in the Platform are described
      in clause 1. You acknowledge and agree that the Platform will undergo
      substantial development before Launch which may result in significant
      changes to the specifications of the Platform (including the Tokens), and
      that any such changes will not constitute a breach of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.2 Your use of the Platform and Tokens will be subject to the Platform’s
      terms of use and the other terms and policies referenced therein that are
      in effect at the time you use the Platform or Tokens (collectively, the “<strong
      >
        Service Agreement
      </strong>”). There will be different versions of the Service Agreement for
      creators, brands, value providers and consumers. The Starflow Group may
      amend the Service Agreement from time to time according to the process set
      out in the Service Agreement. If there is a conflict between the Service
      Agreement and these Terms, these Terms will prevail with respect to any
      issue involving the subject matter of these Terms; in all other respects,
      the Service Agreement will prevail. If there is a conflict between the
      Service Agreement and any Off-Chain Document other than these Terms, the
      Service Agreement will prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.3 Starflow has not designed the Tokens to have the characteristics of an
      investment product or a security and is not selling Tokens as an
      investment product or a security. Tokens:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        do not entitle holders to a return by way of dividend, distribution of
        surplus assets or any financial return from the Starflow Group or the
        Platform; Token holders do not have a right to receive additional Tokens
        or other consideration merely by holding Tokens;
      </li>
      <li>
        do not entitle holders to any right to claim for any debt or liability
        owing or arising from any promissory note, note instrument or debenture
        or other obligations of indebtedness of Starflow or any other entity;
      </li>
      <li>
        do not entitle holders to any obligation from the Starflow Group to
        redeem or buy back any Token or repay any amount paid to it for the
        purchase of Tokens (whether with or without interest);
      </li>
      <li>
        do not entitle holders to vote on, or otherwise exercise discretion to
        govern or influence, any aspect of Starflow’s or any other entity’s
        corporate entity or business;
      </li>
      <li>
        do not entitle holders to receive shareholder/director meeting notices
        or attend shareholders/directors meetings of Starflow or any other
        entity; and
      </li>
      <li>
        do not confer ownership, equity, participation, conversion, redemption,
        repurchase, liquidation or similar rights over (including any right or
        option of conversion into equity or other form of ownership), or rights,
        interests or benefits in, the revenues, profits or other financial
        aspects of, Starflow or any other entity, the Platform, any underlying
        asset (whether tangible, intangible or virtual), or any technology or
        intellectual property developed, acquired or licensed by Starflow or any
        other entity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. Your Purchase of Tokens</h2>

    <p>
      5.1 Starflow will conduct the public phases of the Token Sale only through
      the Token Sale Site. Important information about the Token Sale is set out
      in Schedule 2, including the Token Sale phases and caps, the minimum
      threshold below which the Token Sale may be cancelled, minimum and maximum
      orders, the Token generation and distribution process, the allocation of
      Tokens and Starflow’s expected use of the Token Sale proceeds. If you fail
      to follow the instructions or observe the other information about the
      Token Sale in Schedule 2, you may be delayed or prevented from
      participating in the Token Sale, you may not be able to purchase Tokens
      and you may lose the entire amount of any payment you make.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2 The Token Sale Site is the only site authorised by Starflow to provide
      information about the Token Sale. Before submitting your payment, you must
      confirm that your web browser shows “<strong>
        https://ico.starflow.com/
      </strong>” and that your https connection is secure. If you have submitted
      your payment to an address obtained from any other site you may lose the
      entire amount of your payment and/or may not receive the Tokens you intend
      to purchase. Starflow is not affiliated with and takes no responsibility
      for any such other sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3 You agree to purchase the Tokens in accordance with your Order. Your
      Order is (a) subject to these Terms, (b) subject to acceptance by Starflow
      according to these Terms and (c) subject to adjustment or cancellation
      according to these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>5.4 To purchase Tokens in the Token Sale:</p>

    <p>
      (a) You must accept these Terms and submit your Order according to the
      online process designated by Starflow. Your acceptance of these Terms and
      submission of your Order do not guarantee that you will be able to
      purchase any Tokens during the Token Sale. You may not change or revoke
      your Order after you submit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) To submit your Order, you must initiate a transfer of the Purchase
      Price (as defined in your Order) from your Starflow Wallet (see paragraph
      1 of Schedule 2) to the TS Contract. You agree to bear all gas costs and
      other costs and fees (collectively, the “<strong>
        Transaction Costs
      </strong>”) with respect to that transfer. Your transfer of the Purchase
      Price to the TS Contract could be delayed, rejected or otherwise not
      processed due to (a) your failure to include sufficient Ether (“<strong>
        ETH
      </strong>”) in addition to the Purchase Price to cover the Transaction
      Costs for your transfer and/or (b) network congestion or fault, or other
      errors in the systems processing your transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) If your transfer of the Purchase Price to the TS Contract is
      successful and you satisfy the Compliance Checks (see clause 5.7),
      Starflow will be deemed to have accepted your Order (“<strong>
        Accepted
      </strong>”) and the TS Contract will transfer the Purchase Price (the “<strong
      >
        Amount Paid
      </strong>”) to a multi-signature wallet designated to receive Token Sale
      payments (the “<strong>Sale Account</strong>”). If your Order is Accepted,
      the transaction is final (without prejudice to Starflow’s rights under
      these Terms) and no refund of the Amount Paid or cancellation of your
      Order will be made for any reason except as provided in clause 5.10(a).
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) If Starflow has not exercised its right under clause 5.6 or clause 5.7
      (each, a “<strong>Cancellation Clause</strong>”) and you have complied
      with these Terms (including the applicable provisions in Schedule 2) then,
      within 14 days after your Order is Accepted, the TS Contract will deliver
      the quantity of Tokens specified in your Order (the “<strong>
        Purchased Tokens
      </strong>”) to your Starflow Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.5 If you wish to transfer the Purchased Tokens out of your Starflow
      Wallet, you must have an Ethereum account that supports the ERC-20 Token
      Standard for which you know the address and associated private key and a
      wallet or other token storage mechanism that is compatible with that
      account (collectively, your “<strong>External Wallet</strong>”). Your
      External Wallet must be fully operational and secure at the time you
      transfer Purchased Tokens to it from your Starflow Wallet. You are in all
      respects solely responsible for creating and managing your External Wallet
      and for safeguarding the private keys, passwords and other credentials
      relating to your External Wallet. Starflow reserves the right to prescribe
      additional requirements for your External Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>5.6 Without prejudice to clause 5.7, Starflow reserves the right to:</p>
    <p>
      (a) at any time before Starflow has delivered Tokens to you to fulfil your
      Order, reject or cancel your Order for any reason or no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) in its discretion, for any reason or no reason and at any time before
      Starflow has delivered Tokens to you to fulfil your Order, suspend or
      cancel the Token Sale (in whole or in part). Without prejudice to the
      foregoing, if by 4 July 2018 (the “<strong>Soft Cap Date</strong>”) the
      aggregate proceeds of the Token Sale do not equal or exceed the Minimum
      Sale Threshold (as defined in paragraph 4 of Schedule 2), Starflow may
      cancel the Token Sale. Starflow will post a notice of the suspension (and
      resumption, if any) or cancellation on the Token Sale Site;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) at any time before Starflow has delivered Tokens to you to fulfil your
      Order, reject or cancel your Order if, in Starflow’s discretion, the
      integrity or reputation of Starflow, the Tokens or the Token Sale will or
      will likely be adversely affected by any association with (i) you, (ii)
      your beneficial owners/shareholders, directors or officers (if you are an
      entity), (iii) any other persons otherwise affiliated or associated with
      you ((ii) and (iii) collectively, “<strong>Related Persons</strong>”) or
      (iv) your Order;
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) at any time including after Starflow has delivered Tokens to you to
      fulfil your Order, suspend or cancel the Token Sale, rescind your Order or
      implement other technical or operational measures that destroy or have an
      effect equivalent to destroying the Tokens, if Starflow is required by law
      or regulation or by the order or direction of any competent governmental
      or regulatory authority to carry out such suspension, cancellation,
      rescission or destruction;
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) at any time including after Starflow has delivered Tokens to you to
      fulfil your Order, cancel your Order if you attempt to double spend ETH in
      making payment for your Order. For the purposes of these Terms, an attempt
      to “<strong>double spend</strong>” means an attempt to undertake two
      different transactions on the Ethereum network and spending the same
      account balance on each of the transactions; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) block, terminate, modify, throttle, disconnect or suspend the Token
      Sale (in whole or in part) with respect to you and to reject or cancel
      your Order if, in Starflow’s discretion, you engage in unfair, excessive
      or abusive usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.7 Starflow may at any time, including after Starflow has delivered
      Tokens to you to fulfil your Order, require you to provide documents and
      information that Starflow determines in its discretion to be required to
      enable Starflow to confirm your satisfaction of the Eligibility
      Conditions, to complete the transactions related to the Token Sale and to
      satisfy its internal policy requirements and obligations under applicable
      laws and regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering or
      countering the financing of terrorism or otherwise requiring Starflow to
      vet the parties it transacts with) (“<strong>Compliance Checks</strong>”).
      In Starflow’s discretion, the Compliance Checks may include requiring you
      to submit, and Starflow collecting and reviewing, documents and
      information relating to you or any Related Person. Starflow may also
      procure documents and information about you and the Related Persons from
      independent sources of Starflow’s choosing. If you do not provide the
      required documents and information, or if you do not provide such
      documents and information to the extent satisfactory to Starflow in its
      discretion, or if after receiving any such documents and information
      (whether or not provided by you), Starflow determines in its discretion
      not to transact with you, Starflow may reject or cancel your Order.
      Starflow is not obligated to disclose the content or source of other
      documents or information that Starflow may have relied on to make its
      decision. Starflow’s request for, and your provision of, any information
      or document from you, and any actions or decisions Starflow may take based
      on that information or document, do not affect your obligations under
      clauses 2.2 and 2.3.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.8 If Starflow exercises its right under a Cancellation Clause, Starflow
      is not obligated to notify you of the reasons for its decision not to
      transact with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.9 If Starflow exercises its right under a Cancellation Clause before
      your payment of the Purchase Price or if Starflow exercises its right
      under a Cancellation Clause and you are not eligible for a refund under
      clause 5.10(a), Starflow has no further obligations to you under these
      Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.10 Starflow will refund the Refund Amount (as defined in clause 5.10(b))
      only as provided in clause 5.10(a) and only according to the process set
      out in clause 5.10(b).
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) Starflow will refund the Refund Amount only if Starflow has exercised
      its right under a Cancellation Clause other than clause 5.6(e) or clause
      5.6(f).
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) If you are entitled to a refund under clause 5.10(a), the “<strong>
        Refund Amount
      </strong>” shall be equal to the lesser of:
    </p>
    <p>(i) an amount in ETH equal to the Amount Paid; or</p>
    <p>
      (ii) if the funds held in the Sale Account have been (1) expended to
      defray costs incurred by Starflow in support of the Token Sale and the
      development and promotion of the Platform and/or (2) diminished by loss or
      theft, an amount in ETH equal to the Amount Paid multiplied by the amount
      of funds in the Sale Account as of the refund date and divided by the
      amount of funds that would have been in the Sale Account as of the refund
      date but for the loss or theft,
    </p>
    <p>
      in either case less an amount reasonably determined by Starflow to be
      needed to pay for the Transaction Costs required to execute the refund.
      Starflow will transfer the Refund Amount to your Starflow Wallet (unless
      otherwise agreed with Starflow).
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) When the transfer of the Refund Amount described in clause 5.10(b) is
      included in a mined block of the Ethereum blockchain:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) Starflow’s obligation to refund the Refund Amount under clause 5.10(a)
      is completely satisfied;
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) Starflow has no further obligations to you under these Terms; and
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) you, for yourself and for and on behalf of all natural and legal
      persons who may claim through or under you, on your behalf, or otherwise
      in respect of you, release and forever discharge the Starflow Group and
      its affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,
      employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, attorneys and advisers, and
      all of its and their respective predecessors, successors and assigns, from
      all claims and causes of action of any kind whatsoever, whether under
      common law, statutory, contractual, tortious, equitable or otherwise, and
      all losses, damages, taxes, liabilities, costs and expenses, which you
      have, ever had, may have or hereafter might have, whether known or
      unknown, now existing or which might arise or accrue hereafter, relating
      to or arising under these Terms or any action or transaction under or
      contemplated by these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) In refunding the Refund Amount, under no circumstances is Starflow (i)
      obligated to pay you interest on the Amount Paid or to pay you in fiat
      currency or any other form of virtual currency in lieu of the Refund
      Amount or (ii) responsible or liable for any depreciation in value of ETH
      from the date of transfer of the Purchase Price from your Starflow Wallet
      until the date of transfer of the Refund Amount to you.

      you, (b) if Starflow has not exercised its right under a Cancellation
      Clause, you satisfy the Compliance Checks and you have complied with these

    <h2>6. Your Resale of Rights and Tokens</h2>
    <p>
      6.1 You acknowledge that Starflow’s decision to enter into the transaction
      defined by the Order and these Terms was based in substantial part on your
      identity and reputation. Accordingly, the Order, these Terms and the
      rights granted to you under the Order and these Terms (collectively, the “<strong
      >
        Rights
      </strong>”), as well as the Tokens, are personal to you and you may not
      offer, sell, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, hedge or otherwise transfer
      the Rights or Tokens (any such transaction, a “<strong>Transfer</strong>”),
      or initiate any discussions or provide any documents or information to any
      third party in anticipation of a Transfer, without Starflow’s prior
      written consent, which Starflow may grant or withhold in its discretion.
      Starflow does not intend to consent to any assignment or transfer of
      Rights or Tokens unless the transferee provides representations and
      warranties to Starflow substantially similar to those set forth in clauses
      7.1 and 7.2. You may not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any right or
      interest you have in a Logged payment or Refund Amount.

      6.2 You agree to notify Starflow in writing immediately upon the execution
      of any Transfer to which Starflow has consented, and to provide written
      directions to Starflow for delivery of the Tokens, if not already
      delivered, that are the subject of such a Transfer. To the extent Tokens
      have not yet been delivered, Starflow shall not be responsible for (a) any
      delivery of those Tokens to the wrong party if it has not received written
      directions for the delivery of those Tokens from you in connection with a

      Intended Purposes. However, after the Freeze Period (see paragraph 9 of
      Schedule 2), you may offer, sell, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, hedge or
      otherwise transfer those Tokens (each such transaction, a “<strong>
        Resale
      </strong>”) free of the restrictions contained in clause 6.1; provided
      that any such Resale (a) must be made in accordance with all applicable
      laws and regulations in force at the time of the Resale, including the
      securities laws and foreign exchange restrictions of any applicable
      jurisdiction and (b) does not occur to any person located in the Excluded
      Territory or with an Excluded Person.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4 To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws and
      regulations, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Starflow
      Group from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses,
      costs and expenses (including legal fees) (all, collectively, “<strong>
        Claims
      </strong>”) that arise from or relate to any Resale, including your breach
      of clause 6.1 or clause 6.3. The Starflow Group may participate in the
      defence of a Claim at its expense through counsel of its choosing, and you
      will in any event consult with the Starflow Group about the defence of the
      Claim and any proposed settlement at the Starflow Group’s request. You
      will not have authority to obligate the Starflow Group in any way or to
      compromise any of the Starflow Group’s rights in connection with a defence
      or settlement of any Claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5 If you fail to promptly investigate and defend or settle any Claim,
      then the Starflow Group will have the right to have sole control of the
      defence of the Claim and all negotiations for its settlement or
      compromise, and you shall pay, as they become due, all of the costs and
      expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Starflow Group in
      defending or negotiating settlement of the Claim, and you shall satisfy
      any resulting settlement, award or judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.6 Your obligations under this clause 6 are in addition to, and not in
      lieu of, any other remedies available to the Starflow Group under law,
      equity, or a written agreement between you and Starflow.

    <p>
      10.1 To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws and
      regulations, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Starflow
      Group and its affiliates, and its and their respective past, present and
      future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, members,
      suppliers, vendors, service providers, licensors, agents, representatives,
      predecessors, successors and assigns from and against all claims, demands,
      actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including legal fees) that
      arise from or relate to: (a) your participation in the Token Sale, (b)
      your use of Tokens other than for the Intended Purposes, (c) your
      responsibilities or obligations under these Terms, (d) your violation of
      these Terms (including a breach of clause 7 of these Terms) or (e) your
      violation of any rights of any other person or entity in connection with
      the Token Sale or your dealing in Tokens. This indemnity is in addition
      to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to the Starflow Group
      under law, equity or a written agreement between you and Starflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.2 If a Starflow Group member is obligated to respond to a subpoena or
      other compulsory legal or court order or process relating to subject
      matter that is within the scope of your indemnity under clause 10.1, you
      agree to reimburse its legal fees, as well as its employees’ and
      contractors’ time and materials spent responding to the subpoena or other
      compulsory legal or court order or process at reasonable hourly rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.3 Starflow will promptly notify you of any third-party claim subject to
      clause 10.1, but Starflow’s failure to promptly notify you will only
      affect your obligations under clause 10.1 to the extent that its failure
      materially prejudices your ability to defend the claim. You may: (a) use
      reasonable counsel of your own choosing (subject to the Starflow Group’s
      written consent) to defend any such claim and (b) settle the claim as you
      deem appropriate, provided that you obtain the Starflow Group’s prior
      written consent before entering into any settlement. The Starflow Group
      reserves the right, at your expense, to exercise sole control of the
      defence of the claim and to settle the claim at any time.

      14.15 Each of the terms in these Terms is severable. If a court or other
      tribunal having jurisdiction determines that any term is illegal, invalid
      or unenforceable under applicable law, that determination will not affect
      the other terms, and the parties will promptly begin good faith
      negotiations to replace any invalid or unenforceable terms that are
      essential to these Terms.

    <p>
      14.16 Any translation of these Terms is for reference purposes only. If

    <h2>Schedule 2</h2>

    <h3>Important Information About the Token Sale</h3>
    <h4>1. Prerequisites</h4>

    <p>
      You must follow the process for submitting your Order according to the
      online process designated by Starflow. You acknowledge that your failure
      or refusal to submit the Order for any reason will not entitle you to a
      refund of the Amount Paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Before submitting your Order, you must have:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Created a Starflow account at the Token Sale Site. If you created your
      account before the Public Sale (see paragraph 3 of this Schedule 2), you
      will be eligible to participate in the Public Pre-Sale (see paragraph 3 of
      this Schedule 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Transferred sufficient ETH to the online wallet associated with that
      account (your “<strong>Starflow Wallet</strong>”) to pay for the Tokens
      you seek to purchase plus related Transaction Costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for confirming the address of your Starflow
      Wallet before you transfer ETH to it, and for executing the transfer to
      the confirmed address. If you do not execute the transfer to the correct
      address of your Starflow Wallet, you may permanently lose the entire
      amount of your transfer. You, for and on behalf of all natural and legal
      persons who may claim through or under you, on your behalf or otherwise in
      respect of you, release and forever discharge the Starflow Group and its
      affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
      agents, representatives, suppliers, attorneys and advisers, and all of its
      and their respective predecessors, successors and assigns, from all claims
      and causes of action of any kind whatsoever, whether under common law,
      statute, contract, tort, equity or otherwise, and all losses, damages,
      taxes, liabilities, costs and expenses, which you have, ever had, may have
      or hereafter might have, whether known or unknown, now existing or which
      might arise or accrue hereafter, relating to or arising from transfers
      made to any address other than the correct address of your Starflow
      Wallet.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Accepted Cryptocurrencies</h4>

    <p>
      Starflow will only accept ETH as payment for Orders. Starflow will not
      accept other virtual currencies, digital assets, tokens or fiat
      currencies, whether or not legal tender in any applicable jurisdiction, as
      payment for Orders.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Token Sale Phases, Prices and Caps</h4>

    <p>
      The Token Sale will occur in three phases: an invitation-only pre-sale
      (the “<strong>Private Pre-Sale</strong>”), a public pre-sale (the “<strong
      >
        Public Pre-Sale
      </strong>”), and a public main sale (the “<strong>Public Sale</strong>”).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Private Pre-Sale began at 09:00 CET on 24 October 2017 and will end on
      the date on which the number of Tokens sold in the Private Pre-Sale equals
      or exceeds 13,860,000 (the “<strong>Private Pre-Sale Cap</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Public Pre-Sale will begin at 09:00 CET on 5 March 2018 and will end
      on the date on which the number of Tokens sold in the Public Pre-Sale
      equals or exceeds 63,287,600 (the “<strong>Public Pre-Sale Cap</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Only persons who have been registered for the Public Pre-Sale (see
      paragraph 1 above) will be permitted to participate in the Public
      Pre-Sale. The price of Tokens during the Public Pre-Sale will be 1/4900
      ETH.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Public Sale will begin on the date on which the number of Tokens sold
      in the Public Pre-Sale equals or exceeds the Public Pre-Sale Cap, as
      announced on the Token Sale Site, and will end on the date on which the
      number of Tokens sold in the Public Sale equals 122,852,400 (the “<strong>
        Public Sale Cap
      </strong>”). The date on which the Public Sale Cap is reached is the “<strong
      >
        Token Sale End Date
      </strong>”. The price of Tokens during the Public Sale will be as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Date of Purchase</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Week 1</td>
          <td>1/4200 ETH</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Week 2</td>
          <td>1/4025 ETH</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Week 3</td>
          <td>1/3850 ETH</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Week 4 and after</td>
          <td>1/3500 ETH</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>4. Minimum Sale Threshold</h4>

    <p>
      If on the Soft Cap Date the aggregate number of Tokens sold in the Token
      Sale does not equal or exceed 16,000,000 (the “<strong>
        Minimum Sale Threshold
      </strong>”), Starflow may cancel the Token Sale under clause 5.6(b) of
      these Terms. Starflow may change or waive the Minimum Sale Threshold in
      its discretion.
    </p>
    <h4>5. Minimum and Maximum Orders</h4>

    <p>
      The minimum Order during the Token Sale is 0.1 ETH. An attempt to place an
      Order below that amount will result in an error message and no transfer of
      ETH from your Starflow Wallet will occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no maximum Order. However, if your Order would cause the
      aggregate number of Tokens to be sold in the Token Sale to equal or exceed
      the Public Pre-Sale Cap or the Public Sale Cap, then your Order will be
      accepted to the extent it does not exceed the applicable cap and the
      remaining balance of the Purchase Price will be deemed to be a rejected
      Order and refunded to you under clause 5.10 of these Terms.
    </p>
    <h4>6. Creation and Allocation of Tokens</h4>

    <p>
      On or about 5 March 2018 (the “<strong>TGE Date</strong>”), the TS
      Contract will create 400,000,000 Tokens and will allocate them as follows:
    </p>

    <p>200,000,000 Tokens will be available for sale in the Token Sale.</p>

    <p>
      100,000,000 Tokens will be allocated to (a) a bounty program in support of
      the Token Sale (translations, social media sharing, etc.) and (b) a
      rewards program to incentivise developers to build the Platform in the
      future, to be selected and distributed by Starflow in its discretion.
    </p>

    <p>50,000,000 Tokens will be distributed to Starflow’s advisers.</p>

    <p>50,000,000 Tokens will be distributed to the Starflow team.</p>

    <p>
      In addition, 600,000,000 Tokens will be generated for the User Growth
      Fund, which is intended to stimulate growth of the Platform through the
      distribution of Tokens to creators as a reward for increasing the number
      of consumers following them. The User Growth Fund will vest over a 5-year
      period beginning 1 July 2018 according to an algorithm that will favour
      early growth over later growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starflow may change the User Growth Fund, including the Token distribution
      algorithm, at any time and from time to time according to the needs of the
      business. However, in no case will the total number of Tokens created for
      the User Growth Fund exceed 600,000,000.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the above, Starflow may in its discretion allocate Tokens
      in any manner, whether or not consistent with the foregoing. Starflow
      makes no undertaking, representation or warranty in respect of its
      allocation of Tokens.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Payment Intermediaries</h4>

    <p>
      Starflow advises you not to use third party payment processors, exchange
      wallets or other intermediaries as they may not be compatible with your
      Starflow Wallet. The Starflow Group disclaims all responsibility and
      liability to you if you use a third-party payment processor, exchange
      wallet or other intermediary and are not able to transfer ETH to your
      Starflow Wallet or ETH or Tokens from your Starflow Wallet.
    </p>
    <h4>8. Distribution of Purchased Tokens</h4>

    <p>
      If you are a party to a Private Pre-Sale Agreement then, subject to clause
      5.11 of these Terms, the TS Contract will transfer your Purchased Tokens
      to your Starflow Wallet within 14 days after the Token Sale End Date.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you submitted your Order during the Public Pre-Sale or the Public Sale,
      your Purchased Tokens, if any, will be transferred to your Starflow Wallet
      as provided in clause 5.4(d) of these Terms.
    </p>
    <h4>9. Token Transferability</h4>

    <p>
      Tokens will be frozen and may not be transferred from your Starflow Wallet
      until the end of 14 days after the Token Sale End Date (the “<strong>
        Freeze Period
      </strong>”). After the end of the Freeze Period, your Tokens will be
      transferable subject to clause 6.3 of these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Tokens distributed to Starflow’s team, investors and advisers will be
      locked during the one-year period beginning 5 March 2018.
    </p>

    <h4>10. Use of Proceeds</h4>

    <p>
      Starflow intends to use the proceeds of the Token Sale for the following
      primary purposes in relation to the Starflow Group activities:
    </p>

    <p>
      Engineering: integrating and building ProtoStar &amp; Token functionality
      and further developing the Platform
    </p>

    <h3>Marketing</h3>

    <h4>Legal &amp; business; partnerships</h4>

    <p>
      Administration and operations: accounting and administrative overhead to
      cover business processes
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Starflow may in its discretion use those proceeds for any
      purpose, whether or not consistent with the foregoing. Starflow makes no
      undertaking, representation or warranty in respect of its use of those
      proceeds.
    </p>

    <h2>Schedule 3</h2>

    <h3>Risk Disclosures</h3>
    <h4>Group Risks</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Group Failure.</strong> As a consequence of the realisation of one
      or more of the other risks in this Schedule 3 or of risks not described in
      this Schedule 3, the Starflow Group’s business could fail and the Starflow
      Group could be wound up or dissolved. If the Starflow Group’s business
      fails and the Platform is not transferred to and operated by another
      company, any Tokens you hold would have no utility or value. The Starflow
      Group does not commit that it can or will transfer the Platform to another
      company if its business fails. If the Starflow Group does transfer the
      Platform to another company, the Starflow Group does not commit that the
      other company will operate the Platform to your satisfaction or at all, or
      will continue to accept Tokens for use in the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Management Failures.</strong> The Starflow Group’s management may
      fail to manage its personnel, finances, facilities, information,
      technology and other resources to effectively develop, operate, maintain,
      support, improve, market and sell the Platform, or to manage the growth of
      the business, or to adapt the Platform or its business to changes in
      technology or the markets in which it operates, or to identify and
      effectively respond to the risks described in this Schedule 3 or
      otherwise, the realisation of any or all of which could adversely affect
      the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No Governance Rights. </strong> Tokens do not confer governance or
      similar rights with respect to the Starflow Group or the Platform. The
      Starflow Group will, at its discretion, make all decisions concerning its
      business and the Platform, including decisions to fork or discontinue the
      Platform; to change any pricing, parameter or feature of the Platform; to
      subcontract or outsource the development, maintenance, support and
      operation of the Platform; to sell the Platform; and to sell, merge or
      liquidate the Starflow Group or all or a material part of the Starflow
      Group’s assets, any of which decisions may not be consistent with your
      expectations or interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Business Model Risks. </strong> The Starflow Group designed the
      Platform and the Tokens according to a specific business model. In
      particular, the adoption and success of the Platform depends on several
      factors, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the Starflow Group’s ability to hire top engineers to develop the
        Platform;
      </li>
      <li>
        the Starflow Group’s ability to obtain and maintain licences to operate
        the Platform (where required) in sufficient jurisdictions to remain
        viable;
      </li>
      <li>
        the Starflow Group’s ability to attract sufficient numbers of brands and
        creators to adopt the Tokens as a medium of exchange;
      </li>
      <li>
        the Starflow Group’s ability to attract sufficient numbers of consumers
        to the Platform;
      </li>
      <li>the availability of Tokens to brands and consumers;</li>
      <li>
        the ability of creators and consumers to liquidate their holdings of
        Tokens; and
      </li>
      <li>
        the number of consumers perceiving Tokens to be valuable and thus
        willing to use the Platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the business model of the Platform is flawed, or if the assumptions
      underlying that business model are incorrect, the Platform may
      underperform or fail. The Starflow Group may at its discretion elect to
      change the business model of the Platform in response to competition or
      market requirements, to address perceived flaws, to optimise the model or
      otherwise. Any such changes to the business model of the Platform may fail
      to achieve their purpose and could adversely affect the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Insufficient Funding. </strong> The Starflow Group will depend on
      the proceeds of the Token Sale to fund its operations until such time, if
      ever, that it earns sufficient revenue from the Platform or other
      activities. The proceeds of the Token Sale are cryptocurrencies that may
      increase or decrease in value. The Starflow Group may, at its discretion,
      engage in hedging or similar activities to manage the risk of
      cryptocurrency fluctuations, but those activities may not be sufficient,
      may fail, or may worsen the consequences of those fluctuations. In
      addition, the cryptocurrencies held by the Starflow Group may not be
      convertible to fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies at rates it
      considers favourable, or at all. The cryptocurrencies held by the Starflow
      Group are also subject to loss or theft despite security precautions taken
      by it. If for any reason the Starflow Group’s funds are not sufficient to
      sustain its operations, the Starflow Group may have to reduce or suspend
      its operations, which would adversely affect its ability to develop and
      operate the Platform at the intended level or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> Unanticipated Risks. </strong> The Platform will be launched and
      will evolve in technology, business, economic, legal and tax environments
      that are uncertain and subject to rapid, unpredictable, and potentially
      contradictory evolution. The future risks associated with those
      environments, their respective evolutions, and the interactions among them
      are unknown and unknowable but they could threaten the viability or
      existence of the Platform.
    </p>

    <h4>Product Risks</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Delay.</strong> The Starflow Group may not develop and deploy the
      Platform according to its intended schedule. Future releases of the
      Platform may be delayed, or may not occur at all. Delays in deploying the
      Platform may adversely affect its acceptance in the market and ultimately
      its viability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Inability to Use Tokens. </strong> Holders of Tokens will not be
      able to use them with the Platform until Launch. Launch may be delayed, or
      may not occur at all. Even after Launch, there may be delays in processing
      early transactions while the Platform initialises and stabilises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Failure to Develop and Support the Platform. </strong> As a
      consequence of the realisation of one or more of the other risks in this
      Schedule 3 or of risks not described in this Schedule 3, or because of
      business or technical decisions taken by the Starflow Group in good faith,
      the Starflow Group may fail to launch the Platform with a full set of
      intended features and functions or at all, may discontinue certain
      features and functions of the Platform, may not improve or add to the
      features and functions of the Platform over time, may not adequately
      support the Platform, and may not fix bugs in the Platform in a timely way
      or at all. The Platform (including the Tokens) may therefore not have the
      utility you expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Platform Issues.</strong> The Platform may be degraded,
      interrupted, or fail because of hardware, software, or network defects,
      security breaches, hacking, viruses or other malicious code, natural
      disasters, congestion in underlying networks, and other causes. The
      Starflow Group may be unable to restore the Platform to normal operation
      in a timely way or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Platform Updates.</strong> The Starflow Group may not update the
      Platform in a timely way or at all to fix bugs, address incompatibilities
      arising because of changes in underlying technologies and services,
      respond to user feedback, or react to competitive threats. Any such delays
      or failures could adversely affect the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Failure to Meet Expectations. </strong> The initial and future
      versions of the Platform may not meet your expectations regarding
      features, functions, performance, availability, quality, security, scale,
      price or other attributes that are important to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reliance on Third Parties and Third-Party Systems.</strong> The
      Starflow Group relies on third parties and third-party systems it does not
      control to operate the Platform. Those third parties and third-party
      systems may be unable or unwilling to act as the Starflow Group needs and
      expects, may themselves act maliciously, or may be adversely affected by
      other parties acting intentionally, unintentionally, or maliciously or by
      other events outside their control. The failure of those third parties or
      third-party systems to perform according to the Starflow Group’s needs and
      expectations could adversely affect the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Privacy Risks.</strong> The TS Contract and the Platform are built
      on Ethereum and other public, decentralised platforms. Anyone with
      Internet access can inspect all transactions and other information stored
      in those platforms that is not encrypted. Your Order for and transactions
      involving Tokens, and other information about you or that belongs to you
      that may be processed by or stored in those platforms in connection with
      your use of the TS Contract, the Platform or your dealing in Tokens, may
      be inspected by the public. Certain information may, even if encrypted, be
      associated with you by combining it with other public or non-public
      information.
    </p>
    <h4>Technology Risks</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Core Technology Risks.</strong> The Platform is built with core
      technologies that are in some cases immature and unproven, including
      Ethereum and various open source software applications and libraries. If
      those core technologies do not perform according to the Starflow Group’s
      needs or expectations, have bugs or security vulnerabilities that are not
      or cannot be fixed, become unstable, degraded, or unavailable, are changed
      or forked in a way that is incompatible with the Platform, or are not
      further developed or supported, the Starflow Group may be required to
      change the specifications of the Platform and to reduce or eliminate
      features and functions that are important to you, or to discontinue the
      Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Integration Risks.</strong> The Platform will be integrated with
      third-party services, including any blockchain platform that the Starflow
      Group will build its future technology on and other payment providers.. If
      the integrations with those services fail, or those services are
      unreliable or do not perform as expected, those features within the
      Platform, or the Platform generally, may be adversely affected or delayed.
      Except for the integration of such third-party services in the Platform,
      the Starflow Group is not in any partnership or other association with any
      of those services or the persons operating those services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Smart Contract Risks. </strong> Certain key features of the
      Platform will be implemented in smart contracts on Ethereum. The nature of
      smart contracts makes them difficult to change to fix bugs, improve
      performance, or add features and functions. Updates require us to deploy a
      new version of the smart contract code. The Starflow Group may therefore
      not be able to correct defects in the Platform or improve the Platform to
      meet market needs or respond to competition fast enough or at all, which
      could adversely affect the utility or viability of the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hacking.</strong> All software systems, including Ethereum and the
      Platform, have security vulnerabilities. Through software exploits, social
      engineering and other methods, malicious actors may disrupt, corrupt, or
      interfere with Ethereum and/or the Platform, may defraud the Starflow
      Group or other stakeholders in Ethereum and/or the Platform, including
      you, and may steal Tokens or other valuable data stored in Ethereum or the
      Platform, some of which may belong to or involve you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mining Attacks.</strong> The Tokens are native to and depend on
      Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralised service comprising a global
      peer-to-peer network of many independent node operators. Coordination or
      collusion among node operators could subject Ethereum and its
      stakeholders, including you, to a variety of attacks that could compromise
      the integrity of Ethereum, cause loss, theft, or corruption of Tokens,
      including yours, or increase the cost of using the platform to levels that
      make operation of Ethereum uneconomic and unsustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Governance Attacks.</strong> Tokens are native to and depend on
      Ethereum. The Platform is a decentralised service comprising a global
      peer-to-peer network of many independent node operators. Coordination or
      collusion among node operators could subject the Platform and its
      stakeholders, including you, to a variety of attacks that could compromise
      the integrity of the Platform, cause loss, theft, or corruption of Tokens
      or data, including yours, or increase the cost of using the Platform to
      levels that make operation of the Platform uneconomic and unsustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Security Risks. </strong> The security and integrity of essential
      components of Ethereum and the Platform depend on cryptography. Known and
      currently unknown weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used in
      Ethereum and the Platform and their underlying core technologies, and
      advances in techniques or computing power to circumvent those algorithms,
      may compromise the security and integrity of Ethereum and/or the Platform,
      cause the loss, theft, or corruption of Tokens and other valuable data
      stored in the Platform, including yours, and require the suspension or
      discontinuation of Ethereum and/or the Platform. The existence or future
      development of stronger cryptographic algorithms to replace compromised
      algorithms, and the feasibility of implementing those stronger algorithms
      in Ethereum and/or the Platform and its underlying core technologies, is
      uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prohibitively High Transaction Costs.</strong> All transactions on
      Ethereum, including the transfer of the Tokens, have a cost in ETH (“<strong
      >
        gas
      </strong>”). As at the Effective Date, gas prices for basic transactions
      on Ethereum are nominal. However, gas prices may increase and make the
      trading of the Tokens on Ethereum commercially unfeasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ethereum May be Superseded or Abandoned. </strong> In the Starflow
      Group’s view, the Ethereum platform is the optimum blockchain platform on
      which to develop the Platform. However, the Ethereum platform may be
      superseded by competing blockchain platforms that improve on Ethereum’s
      technology. It is not known whether the Ethereum platform will remain a
      predominant platform.
    </p>
    <h4>Regulatory Risks</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Regulatory Status.</strong> The regulatory status of the Platform,
      the Tokens and the Token Sale is unclear or unsettled in many
      jurisdictions. Regulators in many jurisdictions have announced their
      intention to consider the adoption of regulations to cover cryptographic
      tokens and the markets for them. It is not known if, when or to what
      degree different jurisdictions will interpret existing laws and
      regulations or adopt new laws and regulations that could adversely affect
      the Platform, the Tokens and the Token Sale, or whether those laws or
      regulations would be applied retroactively. Adverse laws or regulations
      and/or the financial and other costs of complying with such regulation
      could cause the Starflow Group to modify or discontinue certain features
      or functions of the Platform, or cause the Starflow Group to discontinue
      the Platform in certain jurisdictions or entirely, or make dealing in
      Tokens regulated or illegal in certain jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Excluded Jurisdictions.</strong> The Token Sale will only be open
      to persons from jurisdictions where the Token Sale (or similar
      cryptographic token offerings) is not prohibited or otherwise restricted;
      in particular, the Token Sale will not be open to persons in the Excluded
      Territory or to Excluded Persons. It is your sole responsibility to
      determine if you are prohibited or restricted from participating in the
      Token Sale, or if such participation constitutes a breach of the laws or
      regulations of your jurisdiction, whether by virtue of your citizenship,
      residency, or other association with a jurisdiction which prohibits or
      otherwise restricts the conduct of the Token Sale (or similar
      cryptographic token offerings). Violation of those prohibitions or
      restrictions may result in criminal and/or administrative penalties being
      imposed on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Compliance Risks.</strong> Complying with laws and regulations
      that apply to the Starflow Group and/or the Platform may be costly and may
      divert a significant portion of the Starflow Group’s attention and
      resources. If the Starflow Group must have a licence or other government
      registration or approval to operate the Platform in a jurisdiction, there
      is no guarantee that it will qualify for or be granted the necessary
      licence, registration, or approval. The lack of a necessary licence,
      registration or approval would restrict or prevent the Starflow Group from
      operating in that jurisdiction. If the Starflow Group fails to comply with
      applicable laws or regulations, it could be subject to significant legal
      liability and financial and reputational losses which may adversely affect
      the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tax.</strong> The tax status of the Platform, the Tokens and the
      Token Sale is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. Adverse
      interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or adoption of new
      adverse tax laws and regulations could result in unanticipated and
      potentially retroactive tax liability for the Starflow Group and other
      stakeholders in the Platform, including you. Those adverse tax
      consequences could cause the Starflow Group to modify or discontinue
      certain features or functions of the Platform or increase prices for the
      Platform, or cause the Starflow Group to make the Platform unavailable in
      certain jurisdictions, or make dealing in Tokens subject to tax in certain
      jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Capital Control Risks.</strong> Some jurisdictions impose strict
      controls on the cross-border flow of capital. The application of those
      controls to digital tokens like the Tokens is uncertain. Holders of Tokens
      may be subject to those controls and/or enforcement of those controls at
      any time.
    </p>
    <h4>Market Risks</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Lack of Market Penetration.</strong> The Platform may not attract
      users and/or third parties at the intended level or at a level sufficient
      to become or remain useful or viable. Any such lack of use or interest
      could negatively affect the development of the Platform and/or the utility
      or value of the Tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Competition.</strong> Other organisations may develop services
      that compete with the Platform, and may do so with some or all of the open
      source software underlying the Platform. There are also existing online
      and offline digital entertainment services that provide services
      materially similar to the Platform. The Platform may encounter difficulty
      in competing with those existing or future services which may adversely
      affect the adoption and use of the Platform, and ultimately the viability
      and continued existence of the Platform. It is unknown whether or to what
      extent, if any, those competing services may be interoperable with the
      Platform or may accept Tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Secondary Markets for Tokens.</strong> As at the start of the
      Token Sale, there is no public market for Tokens. Virtual currency
      exchanges and other secondary markets for the Tokens may never exist. Even
      if the Tokens are listed or traded on a secondary market, there is no
      assurance that an active or liquid trading market for Tokens will develop
      or, if developed, will be sustained. The Starflow Group has no financial
      or other relationship with, and does not endorse, any such exchange or
      secondary market that elects to transact in Tokens, except as the Starflow
      Group may publicly announce. Exchanges and secondary markets may be new,
      undercapitalised, illiquid, volatile, operated by persons with minimal or
      no relevant experience, and subject to minimal or no regulatory oversight,
      making use of them susceptible to a variety of market, financial, fraud,
      and other risks that could result in your loss of Tokens or other losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Price Volatility.</strong> The price of Tokens in the Token Sale
      may not be indicative of the price of Tokens on public markets. The Tokens
      have no intrinsic value at the time they are created. The price of Tokens
      on public markets may be extremely volatile, may decline below the price
      you pay for Tokens, or may diminish to zero in response to various
      factors, some of which are outside the Starflow Group’s control,
      including, among others, the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) the volatility of the prices of cryptographic tokens generally and in
      response to events that have little or nothing to do with the Starflow
      Group;
    </p>
    <p>(b) general economic conditions and macroeconomic changes;</p>

    <p>
      (c) changes and innovations in blockchain technology, the industry sectors
      in which the Starflow Group operates, and other technologies and markets;
    </p>

    <p>
      (d) the Starflow Group’s announcements pertaining to strategic direction,
      key personnel, financial and operational results, partnerships,
      significant transactions, new products, and other events;
    </p>

    <p>
      (e) activities and announcements of the Starflow Group’s competitors; and
    </p>

    <p>
      (f) third-party reports, recommendations, and statements regarding Tokens,
      the Platform or the Starflow Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Risk of Dilution.</strong> Starflow will create and distribute
      Tokens other than those being sold in the Token Sale. In many cases those
      other Tokens will be distributed for significantly less consideration per
      Token than you paid for your Tokens. The distribution of those other
      Tokens will increase the overall supply of Tokens in the market, and may
      affect as well as result in downward pressure on the market price of
      Tokens on any public market on which the Tokens may trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Fluctuation in the Value of the Token Relative to a Reference Fiat
        Currency.
      </strong>
      Payments for transactions among brands, creators and value providers will
      be made in Tokens. Payments from consumers to creators for content,
      services or items on the Platform will be made in ProtoStars. If a
      transaction paid in Tokens is actually priced in a reference fiat currency
      (e.g., USD), then a larger number of Tokens may be necessary to pay for
      those fees to the extent that the value of Tokens declines relative to
      that reference fiat currency. Similarly, a consumer wishing to obtain
      ProtoStars to access premium content or other items on the Platform will
      need to pay more fiat currency for ProtoStars to the extent that the value
      of Tokens declines relative to that fiat currency. In addition, the
      Starflow Group has not yet established (a) the processes for determining
      the fees payable to the Platform, if any, for transferring Tokens outside
      the Platform (e.g., as a precursor to exchanging Tokens on a secondary
      market), (b) the processes for determining rewards to be issued from the
      User Growth Fund or (c) whether any of those fees or rewards will be
      denominated by reference to Tokens or to a reference fiat currency. If the
      transaction fees to be paid to the Platform or the rewards to be issued
      from the User Growth Fund are determined by reference to a reference fiat
      currency, then the number of Tokens needed for those purposes may
      fluctuate with value changes to the reference fiat currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Market Perception.</strong> The market price of Tokens could be
      adversely affected by negative publicity, social media commentary,
      rumours, and other information, whether or not true, about the Starflow
      Group, the Platform, the Tokens, the technology on which the Platform is
      based (including Ethereum) and/or the legal or regulatory environment in
      which the Platform operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>General Economic and Market Risks.</strong> Adverse changes in
      general global and regional economic and market conditions may adversely
      affect the Starflow Group, the suppliers and third parties on which the
      Starflow Group depends, and users and prospective users of the Platform,
      all of which may adversely affect the availability, reliability,
      performance, adoption and success of the Platform.
    </p>
    <h4>Participant Risks</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Private Key Risks.</strong> You, not Starflow, are responsible for
      securing the private key that controls your Tokens. If you do not know
      your private key, you will permanently lose your Tokens. If your private
      key is lost or stolen, you could permanently lose your Tokens. If you
      store your private key with a third-party wallet or vault service, you
      will permanently lose your Tokens if you forget and are unable to recover
      your credentials to access the third-party service, or if the third-party
      service malfunctions, is corrupted or compromised, makes your credentials
      or private key available to others, ceases operations, is hacked, or
      otherwise cannot make your private key available to you or loses control
      of your private key.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Token Sale Process Risks. </strong> The process for submitting an
      order and receiving Tokens will be described on the Token Sale Site. If
      you do not carefully follow that process, you may not be able to
      participate in the Token Sale or purchase Tokens, you may permanently lose
      the funds you intend to submit as payment for your order, or you may
      permanently lose the Tokens you have purchased. The Sale Account and your
      Starflow Wallet, like all software systems, have security vulnerabilities.
      Malicious actors may attempt to steal funds and/or Tokens (as applicable)
      from the Sale Account and/or your Starflow Wallet, including by hacking
      it. Funds and/or Tokens (as applicable) in the Sale Account and/or the
      Registered Address are also subject to loss or theft by other means. You
      accept all risk of loss or theft of your payments from the Sale Account or
      your funds or Tokens from the Registered Address.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Incompatible Wallet. </strong> The technical requirements for
      receiving Tokens will be described on the Token Sale Site. If you use a
      wallet or other technology that does not conform to those technical
      requirements, or if you use a third-party service whose wallet or other
      technology does not conform to those technical requirements, your Tokens
      may be permanently lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uninsured Losses. </strong> Tokens are not insured by the Starflow
      Group or by any public agency. If your Tokens are lost or stolen, you will
      have no recourse unless you insure them at your expense. The Starflow
      Group cannot issue new or substitute Tokens to replace lost or stolen
      Tokens.
